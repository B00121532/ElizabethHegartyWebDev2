<p>
.Hi guys,</p>
<p>My name is Elizabeth Hegarty. I am twenty three years old and I live in Ireland. I done my leaving cert back in 2015 and went on to study accounting technicians in Pearse Street Dublin. I only made it through one year and realised that this was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I took a couple of years out of college and worked as a bar maid in a hotel in Maynooth.</p>
<p>	I reapplied for the CAO in 2018 and got my place to start Creative Digital Media in ITB which is not TU Dublin Blanchardstown Campus. I now realise this is what I have always wanted to do as it is not about memorising and learning from a book, it is about using the creative side of your brain. As I am dyslexic I have always found reading, spelling, maths and writing extremely hard so this course is perfect for me.
When I arrived to TU Dublin I was scared as I was twenty two, one of the eldest in the year and did not know how I was going to fit in but now I have a great circle of friends which is one reason why I love this course. They make everyday fun and we are always there to help each other.
The one thing I have learnt from this course is that even though we are learning about different things, we have been given the freedom to use our imaginations and create amazing things.
